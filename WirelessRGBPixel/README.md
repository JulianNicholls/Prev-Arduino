Early testing code/electronics for proof of concept.

Wireless RGB Pixel is just that, a wireless (NRF24L01+) RGB led (WS2812b) controlled by an Atmel ATTiny85. One or more 'pixels' can be controlled by an Arduino with another NRF24L01+ module.

It is hoped that many of these 'pixels' can be manufactured and installed somewhere and controlled to create an interesting light show.
